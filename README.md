# Portfolio

## I am Brody, and this is my repository portfolio!

I created this portfolio during my summer program and added projects I made during that time. The following are the projects I created



## Number Guessing Game
This is a basic guessing game, you have to guess a number chosen by the code between 1 - 10 until you get it right!

### Project Bugs 
1. After Guessing the right number, choosing the option to end the game will not end the game and will continue on (Still present)
2. When wanting to play again, the number would always stay the same (Fixed)


## Basic Calculator
Made a basic calculator that can Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide 

### Project Bugs
1. Dividing by 0 will break the calculator (Fixed)


## Graphic Design
